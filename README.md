# DatabaseProject
# Personal project for a potential database template for a client
# Using my existing knowledge of databases and how they are used as an end-user, I wanted to create a database that could be used after identifying a gap in the market for a cheaper and more basic alternative to what is being used in the Market Data industry.
# I wanted to keep this database as simple and as functional as possible so that smaller Investment Banks, Brokers, etc. would be able to transition to using this without any of the additional complications that some of the bigger Inventory Management Tools used in the industry have, therefore tailoring it to the needs of a smaller business that prioritises simplicity.
